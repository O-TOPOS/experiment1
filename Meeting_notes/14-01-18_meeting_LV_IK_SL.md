### Meeting Notes - 14/01/2018

1. definition of project
- Our aim is to create a simple web-app which takes an input 'origin', 'destination'
and it outputs a route based on Points of interests ('POI')
- the Web-app will visualise the map and has a basic UI that allows for simple
'origin' and 'destination' form boxes.
- we will experiment with different cloud-services. This includes the use of
OSM-api and OSM-routing-api.

2. Initial steps
- LV will develop the basic steps to create a Django framework. We will within
a unified-framework to ensure develop
within our own local machine initially that has the same settings, modules,
libraries to ensure this can be easily replicated.
