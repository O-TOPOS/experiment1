# Notes
## Ideas
- People marks what he has visited: eg. Dashboard with an interactive map of a world (eg Scratch Map)
- 1 color: where you have been , other color: where you want to go
- More like social media
- Homepage as an interactive game environment
- apply filters e.g. weather/ flights/ MONEY
- base-mapping: according to the scale of the zoom: other factors start appearing eg. hotels or other attractions  bars ...
- market analysis / research of existing similar ideas e.g. kayak
- where you share the experiences? connect to other social media

# NEXT STEPS
- create a tasklist and distribute tasks (share and express interest)
- buy domain otopos
- mapzen
- basic app scenario
- groups of 2?
- schedule meetings (regular?)
- smaller catchups every 2 weeks?
