# How to collaborate in Github?

**You need:**

- Github desktop
- Atom / any other text editor

**Before starting..**

.. you need to clone the 'experiment1' repository in your machine.

## Branches and Pull requests

For collaborating in Github, everyone should create a branch (from master) to work on.  All changes should be made in that branch and once happy with the changes, then the branch is merged with the master branch. This means that everyone can be working on different things in his individual branch and then push all changes to the master branch. The individual branches can be deleted once merged with the master.

In Github desktop:

1. Select the repository you are working and syncronise. This will get the latest updates from github (online) to your local machine.

2. Create a new branch. Select to Add a branch and specify a name like 'routing_dev'.

3. Select to publish the branch. This will make available the branch in github (online). (If you have your text editor open, observe the bottom right corner of your text editor. The branch has changed from master to 'routing_dev'.)

4. Make all the changes you wish. Once you are finished commit all the changes to the 'routing_dev' branch and syncronise. This will push all changes you made to github (online).

5. Now you are ready to merge those changes with the master branches. In github desktop there is an option to Send a pull request. Select the Send pull request option and then select the link to view pull request online.

6. Then select the Merge pull request option. This will merge the changes from the 'routing_dev' with any changes from the 'master' branch.

7. If the merge is successful you can delete the 'routing_dev' branch.
